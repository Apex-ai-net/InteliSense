# 🎯 IntelliSense Strategic Pivot: Enterprise → Mid-Market

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Strategic Shift**: IntelliSense has pivoted from targeting **enterprise companies** (Fortune 1000) to focusing on **high-growth mid-market companies** ($10M-$500M revenue) expanding into Orange County.

**Key Insight**: Enterprise companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon already have established relationships with major CRE firms like Voit. Our competitive advantage lies in identifying growing companies **before** they establish these relationships.

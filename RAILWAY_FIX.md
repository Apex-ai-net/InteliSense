# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
Railway is using the Dockerfile instead of Nixpacks, causing npm ci failures during deployment.

## Root Cause
When both `Dockerfile` and `railway.json` with `"builder": "NIXPACKS"` exist, Railway defaults to using the Dockerfile.

## Solution
**Delete the Dockerfile** to force Railway to use Nixpacks as specified in railway.json.

## Why This Works
- Your `railway.json` is perfectly configured for Nixpacks
- Nixpacks handles Node.js applications better than custom Dockerfiles
- Your build command `npm ci && npm run db:generate` will work perfectly with Nixpacks
- All Puppeteer dependencies will be automatically handled

## Steps to Fix
1. Delete the `Dockerfile` from the repository
2. Railway will automatically trigger a new deployment using Nixpacks
3. The deployment should succeed

## Expected Result
âœ… Successful Railway deployment with mid-market strategy configuration active
